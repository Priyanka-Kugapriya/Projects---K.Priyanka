Halahal,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6113125/,"Halahal begins and ends with scenes set in the night-time. In between, characters wind in and out of police stations, colleges, hostel rooms and hotels, shining a feeble torchlight on that elusive thing called justice.
The title of the Eros Now original film loosely means venom. Toxicity is delivered by the bucketful over 97 minutes. Its first splash is in the form of a murder disguised as a suicide. Somebody wants the medical student Archana out of the way, and that somebody has succeeded.
The set-up is hardly new - bereaved father teaming up with law enforcement's last honest representative. Yet, writer Ghibran Noorani and director Randeep Jha bring energy and freshness to familiar material. The fluid narrative smoothly moves from one scene to the next and deftly scales every tier of the multi-crore admissions swindle. Despite a few plotting missteps, Halahal benefits from sharp casting, convincing performances, an unsentimental approach, and an unwavering moral purpose.",negative

Baaghi 3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5532336/,"Best acting from tiger Shroff...

Usse accha 1 month ka Brazzers premium lo",negative
Baaghi 3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5529992/,"#FinalVerdictThe biggest problem with Baaghi 3 is that there's hardly any storyline in the film. Sajid Nadiadwala's adaptation is lame and it rests on a wafer-thin plot. What could've been an exhilarating thriller, with pulse-pounding moments, ends up being a run of the mill saga, courtesy a half-baked screenplay (Farhad Samji). Since Baaghi 3 goes beyond the shores of India, director Ahmed Khan and his team of writers (Sparsh Khetarpal, Tasha Bhambra, Madhur Sharma) could've used their imagination and packed the film with moments that would've made your jaws fall on your knees. Baaghi 3 is a big film in all respects - big stars, big canvas, big expenditure on VFX, big expectations. Sadly, it's a big, big, big letdown as well.The experience with Baaghi 3 is like, you enter a posh restaurant, waiting for a sumptuous meal to be served, but what's served on your plate is vada-pau. Baaghi 3 takes you back to the 1970s Bollywood, when illogical situations, blood and gore, for no rhyme or reason, were the main ingredients that made the junta break into taalis. Sorry, the formula doesn't work anymore! Seriously, what were director Ahmed Khan, Sajid Nadiadwala (story adaptation) and Farhad Samji (screenplay & dialogues) thinking when they went ahead with this apology of a script? It's perfectly okay to pay homage to the masala films of yore, but the new interpretation has to make some sense at least. The one thing that you realize after watching Baaghi 3 is, no amount of gloss, glam and top-notch stars can ever substitute for a riveting script. Great stars, great styling and great visuals work as long as the script is great.Farhad Samji's screenplay is a complete mess. In fact, if at all there would be Razzies in Bollywood, Farhad Samji should be nominated proto for coming up with a slipshod, brainless and witless screenplay. What saddens your heart is the fact that Sajid Nadiadwala and Fox Star Studios, the producers of Baaghi 3, have spared no efforts in giving the film a spectacular look. The vision is perfect, but how about narrating an absorbing and attention-grabbing story? You remember Baaghi 3 for its striking visuals, not storyline. It's like embellishing priceless and precious jewels on a mannequin. The fight becomes too Bollywoodish as the hero eliminates an entire army of terrorists, is difficult to gulp! Perhaps, director Ahmed Khan's intentions are right, to make a hard-hitting film that marries realism and fiction beautifully, but the writing indulges in too many cinematic liberties and that's precisely why Baaghi 3 goes off target.However, lovers of action fares are in for a treat, since the stunts, action and chase sequences in Baaghi 3 are truly captivating. Sure, a few sequences aren't for the faint-hearted, but you can't help but put your hands together for these sequences and the man behind those death-defying stunts. Coupled with top-notch cinematography (Santhana Krishnan Ravichandran) and stylish action (Ram Chella-Laxman Chella, Kecha Khamphakdee) the film begins to grow as reel after reel unspools. But, alas, the film goes for a toss in the second hour. Things actually stagnate as the hero turns into super-hero and combats an army of villains on land, sea and air. Director Ahmed Khan and his team of writers seem to have substituted action for content and that's the most glaring flaw. In fact, you feel that the director and screenplay writers must've decided to go on a vacation in the second hour, entrusting the responsibility on the stunt directors to conclude the second hour.Baaghi 3 is soaked in high-voltage drama and action, with a consistent undercurrent of tension. As a matter of fact, there's an overdose of action in the film, though, I must admit, a few action pieces are deftly executed. But the absence of a riveting and absorbing screenplay looms large in the post-interval portions. Sure, some sequences do hit you hard, but the writing tilts heavily towards been-there-seen-that kind of situations persistently, promising little or no surprise as the plot unravels. The background score (Julius Packiam) enhances the impact, while the dialogue (Farhad Samji) are power-packed at times, but plain mediocre at places. The film's music is awful but thankfully, there aren't too many songs.Director Ahmed Khan tries to camouflage the defect (lacklustre screenplay) with stylish execution, hair-raising stunts, eye-filling visuals, but let's not forget that the moviegoer wants to listen to a captivating story at the end of the day. Everything else is secondary! The film goes on and on and on with unwanted scenes galore (editing: Rameshwar S. Bhagat), the outdated love angle and the lenggggggthy fight sequences. Director Ahmed Khan seems to have taken the audience for granted. He has concentrated more on giving the film a slick look than narrating a gripping story and this fact reverberates at several points in the film. There's no denying that Baaghi 3 bears the stamp of an upmarket product all through, but how one wishes the director and the writers would've ensured that the film has a power-packed screenplay to offer as well.Baaghi 3 belongs to Tiger Shroff completely. No two opinions on that. Take Tiger out of this film and the movie is a big zero. He's the lifeline of this project and his performance will be loved by the masses. Shraddha Kapoor looks gorgeous and acts very well. Riteish Deshmukh is relegated to the backseat. What did Riteish see in this role? Ankita Lokhande's character lacks meat. Jackie Shroff and Vijay Varma are alright. Jaideep Ahlawat and Jameel Khoury evoke terror that one would associate with their characters. They are fantastic.To sum up, Baaghi 3 is regressive cinema with a capital R. The film has some engrossing moments in the first half, that's about it. The post-interval portions are an absolute downer. The plot is formulaic, while the screenplay is riddled with cinematic liberties. Fans of Tiger Shroff might patronize the movie; however, the aam junta might not take a liking to it. At the box-office, the film will embark on a strong start, but it doesn't have the merits to sustain after the initial curiosity subsides. Baaghi 3 fails as a film.",positive
Guilty,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5534671/,As a girl i feel this movie concept is totally wrong .

What a wrong justification this was .,negative
Guilty,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5533383/,"Guilty lacks the seriousness of Pink and Section 375. A college student tags her college mate in a MeToo post and he files defamation case against her. His girlfriend believes him and the guy's counsel investigates the matter.
It could have turned into a wonderful mystery, if not a powerful film that talks about sexual assaults. But, it turns into a messy attempt by an new filmmaker. Since, it is just a defamation case, all the seriousness that we had in Pink and Section 375 is just missing here.
The college students in this film have nothing to do besides taking drugs and churning out bad songs. Had it been a police investigation, it would have been engaging. A detailed court session is also missing here. What we get instead is a five minute long scene inside a court.
Kiara at last finds out that his boyfriend is indeed guilty and reveals about him during a music fest in the college. Then she goes on to give a monologue rather than let the victim speak. Also, it is clear evident that she is struggling to act. Instead of becoming a superb commentary on sexual assaults and how the victims don't get a chance to speak out, this film becomes a teen drama about kids smoking weed and kissing inside classroom even when the professor is taking lesson.",positive

Ram Singh Charlie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6034895/,"There were times when Circus was one of the best source of entertainment for a weekend fun - watching clowns, acrobats, dancers, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers and magicians perform various antics who kept us engaged. However, with the advent of smartphones and other gadget, circus shows took a back-seat. Ram Singh Charlie,premiered today, gives a harsh reality of the performers, who bring smile on our face, but become butt of jokes outside the world of circus.Ram Singh Charlie tells the story of a circus artist, Ram Singh (Kumud Mishra) whose life turns topsy-turvy when the owner of the Jango Circus decides to shut it down owing to the unbearable losses. Ram Singh and his family is transformed into out-of-circus world where he struggles to make the end meet. Ram Singh does all the odd jobs under the sun and swear to start his own circus one day but fate has its own story to tell..Directed by Nitin Kakkar, who made the hilarious Filmistaan and Jawaani Jaaneman, steps into the different world of circus which gave us a wonderful memory of our childhood during the 90's days when it was running to packed houses. However, with technology taking over in form of electronic gadgets, audience showed little interest and circus almost died down.Ram Singh Charlie opens in a flashback mode when the world of a talented artist collapses and his struggle period begins who has no other skills to survive. To make the ends meet, he does all odd jobs ranging from cartoon character to make kids birthday party exciting, hand-rickshaw puller and car-cleaning guy in the hot and humid condition of Kolkata. It is only when he performs at the Father Day event at his son's school, he realizes that he is meant to entertain and would do anything to bring up his own circus. Till this point, the film keeps you engaged but an event when one of his ex-colleague is physically assaulted halts the pace of the film. Here after, the film loses the focus and becomes a melodrama, which could have better executed until the climax. Despite the shortcomings, the outstanding effort by Nitin Kakkar and writer Sharib Hashmi could not be overlooked. After Mera Naam Joker and DD 90's serial Circus, not much attempts were made revolving around the lives of artists in the colorful world of circus. Ram Singh Charlie shows how difficult it becomes for the circus artists in the real world due to their physical appearances and shortcomings.Ram Singh Charlie also scores in terms of editing and story line. Though the cinematography, art direction and background score is decent, Ram Singh Charlie is a performance driven film and it is Kumud Mushra who finally proves that he can carry a film on his shoulder, despite playing diverse supporting characters in big-budgeted cinemas. The versatile actor excels in his role as Ram Singh and brings out the emotions whom you will be able to relate. Divya Dutta is another gem of an actor who keeps on surprising with her powerful performances. I liked Farrukh Seyyer in the role of Shah Jehan and he played it confidently.Overall, Ram Singh Charlie works on electrifying performances, strong storyline with a beautiful life lesson - Never Ever Give Up. Encouraging 3/5",negative

Mee Raqsam,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6017058/,"Giving it 2 stars - 1 for the story & emotion behind it and 2nd for the music/lyrics.Yes the daughter & father bonding was absolutely beautiful to watch and the fact that art has no religion or boundaries and one has to pursue one's dreams which means there will be a lot of sacrifices and a heavy price to pay.But there is a way of telling any story - creating a feature film demands a lot more. It could have been due to the fact that this film did not get enough finance to hire the right people in the production team.The lead character Maryam did not seem to have to learn a single step, it was just as if she was born with it - which doesn't happen, I cringed at the lack of struggle shown.
In the opening scene Maryam's mother performs in front of her for a minute and dies suddenly for absolutely no reason - weakness of the screenplay. An intelligent viewer would demand a better explanation no matter how short.
Saleem, the tailor and Maryam's father cannot even afford to buy 2 kilograms of sugar although he manages to afford paying for her dance school fees, the struggle & effort to earn that money or the source where he arranged it from would have connected the dots.
The girl who played Maryam might be a talented young dancer herself and hence selected to play this character but the accent coach should have worked a little harder to make her pronounce the word ""Khaala"" correctly - it was quite irritating to hear incorrect throughout the movie. I expected something better from people like Baba and Shabana Azmi being behind this project.
And what about her being the only girl wearing a head scarf, it would have made more sense if other Muslim females including her aunt and cousins and those Muslim girls who featured in the sewing class scene were made to wear some ""burqa"" or ""hijaab"" or a head scarf.
Editing, Cinematography & Dialogues were decent enough.

My Client's Wife,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5970857/,"The film apparently resembles the loud filmmaking of RGV in his cult thriller ""Kaun"". Sometimes the film seems like an example of bad filmmaking with loud bgms and dialogues which is written like a CID TV show. The film deserves some credit the way it unfolds itself and despite being loud it keeps you guessing. The frequent dutch angels reminds you of the old hindi thriller films .The film lacks good or even decent editing but maybe the budget is the reason behind that .The film although revolves around a family but it completely deviates from the exploring the main characters and also several key aspects of the film is ignored. The film invests all it's attention to bring in the twist in the end in the most bizarre way. At first the twist may shock you or even to some extent impress you but when they try to match the dots to justify the twist you will remain unsatisfied .The twist may confuse you in two ways either it's completely lame or shockingly well made. The performance from Anjali Patil is one of the few bright spots of the film,her performance is what keeps you engaged throughout but Sharib Hasmi and Abhimanyu Singh are not utilized properly although they tried their best.
6/10",negative
My Client's Wife,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5957405/,"This is what happens when a brilliant story meets brilliant acting and fantastic direction. This movie will bind you till the end and in the climax you'll be shocked of what actually happened. Abhimanyu Singh is strong as usual but Anjali Patil and Sharib Hashmi both have done a great job with their roles. Writer and director of the movie Prabhakar Pant has made some fantastic short movies before that i have watched but this one is way too good. Must say, it's a one time watch for sure.",positive

Kriya,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6056640/,"Following the death of her father, a woman puts her date to work in helping the rest of her family prepare the body to cross over into the next life, yet when he realizes the true nature of what they invited him over for he tries to get out of the impending ceremony before it's too late.Overall, this was a highly enjoyable slow-burn genre effort. Among it's better qualities is the casual usage of the family's strict traditions and beliefs coming to the forefront of the story here. Initially believing he's scoring a random hook-up at a nightclub and going back to her house where he discovers the grisly sight, this then turns into the series of family's rituals for their dying husband that he keeps inadvertently messing up and causing irritation amongst them because of the miscommunication. The various paraphernalia and ritual aesthetics around the house and the tactics they have to perform, from the prayers and preparations that have to be offered and ignoring the convulsions of the deceased who may or may not be offering a warning, this generates a fine atmosphere for the film early on. From here, the way the ritual gets carried out with exacting precision makes this feel quite dark and chilling. The idea of the figure haunting them in the house is a truly nightmarish figure with the muddy appearance, darkened atmosphere hiding the majority of its appearances until the last possible moment in regards to where the outcome of this one shifts leading into the last half. Featuring the full reveal of what they're intending with the ceremony in regards to fending off the effects of the curse, the change in character carries on as his reduced mental state at being there causes him to undergo the ritual as intended which adds a special air of menace to the scenes. As this offers a fun and enjoyable atmosphere during the best moments of the film, this has a lot to like overall. There are some big flaws to be found in the film. One of it's biggest issues is seemingly random and unnecessary extra elements present in the storyline here to make this somewhat longer than it really should be. The focus on the in-fighting and constant disagreements between the family to the point of feeling exceptionally out-of-place in such an event. That's where this tends to feel underwhelming as the idea comes off forced due to the rigid structural system employed for the ritual is so where it feels the need to deviate into petty squabbling and bickering from the sisters doesn't seem natural. Plus, that also has the unfortunate side-effect of making this way too relaxed and slow-going, taking forever to get to the main point of the story which can make this seem a little too long at points. It's not distracting but has enough to lower it.Rated Unrated/R: Violence, Full Male and Female Nudity and Language.",negative

The Hidden Strike,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5995513/,"One of the worst Indian Army based film I've seen throughout my life...
The uniform was completely wrong. Ranks were wrong.
No proper planning before mission? Our Army is not so stupid to start a mission without planning it out properly.
Please don't take such movies without proper reserch being done at least basic research is to be done regarding ranks and uniforms.
And never will an officer leave a man behind to die.Above are just a few out of all the stupid things in the movie.Please don't take such movies.Rated 1 as I couldn't rate less than that but I really will rate it minus 10 (-10) .",negative
