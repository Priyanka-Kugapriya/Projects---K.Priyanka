Dil Bechara,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5963527/,"SSR has done some amazing work in some amazing movies. This is not one of them. Yeah he's charming and fun to watch like always but it's not his best movie. You gave this movie 10/10 based of guilt - guilt of never watching his movies that were actually worthy of your 10/10.

Bulbbul,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5850689/,"7.5/10
Bulbbul is a unique story circling around a girl who's married to an older man and goes to a Haveli. 20 years later, she's a respected Thakurayan but what follows after is a well written but predictable mystery.
The movie is great in all aspects. I loved the performances of all the actors. But I think the character of bulbbul could have been developed better and there'd have been twists in the tale.Nevertheless a great watch!!!",negative
Bulbbul,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5851580/,"This movie is what Netflix needed and infact what Our movie industry needed.

Lootcase,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5956408/,"I saw a lot of critics have given not so good rating. Going by what we are witnessing with the likes of Rajeev Masand, relying on critics is disastrous. My rating for the movie is a complete 10/10! It's an awesome movie and great performances by all the actors-Kunal as usual with his epic comic timing, Ranvir as the diabolical cop, Vijay Raaz as the nature loving Don, all of them have given their best. It's a laugh riot right from the beginning. Maybe they could have avoided the songs but that can be pardoned. Go for it guys you won't be disappointed. You will thoroughly enjoy the movie",positive

The film has ample amt of action, gory stabbings, sun soaked settings, decent acting n direction.
It has no hand held shaky cam stuff n no poorly lit scenes.

Climax,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5833337/,"Why does IMDB allow 10/10 ratings and reviews from people who are obviously friends or family of the production crew of what is a really terrible movie.
It is nothing as promotions state....horror, suspense, adult, erotic, thriller.... none of those genre are there.
Why Mia Malkova is in this film is anyone's guess. If you did not know her, Mia Malkova is a US minor porn star, performing in hardcore sex movies.
Malkova is the focus of the 2018 documentary film (also made by Ram Gopal Varma, the director of this movie), God, Sex and Truth about the strength of women sexuality and beauty. In an interview, she revealed that ""the only reason she got into porn is because she loves sex and the porn world is the safest and the best place to explore sex in all its forms.""
For Ram Gopal Varma to have cast her in this movie after the documentary, suggests to me he must be a big fan of hers.
So that's the background...The movie.... it drags on and on with no real plot. Acting is poor, dialogue makes no sense. The music score just does not compliment the movie at all.
The latter part of the movie with the ritual scene around the fire is ever so reminiscent of a similar scene of ""Apocalypse Now"".
The movie is obviously filmed in India by viewing the sets/backgrounds, so the appearance of Caucasians and what appears to be black Americans just does not wash with the scenes. With 10 minutes remaining in the movie, the closing scenes (which looked like a high school made version of Mad Max) could have ended the movie right there.... it did not need to drag on the scene fora further 10 minutes of repetition that was already established in the eyes of the viewer.In all, the movie comes across as a senseless piece of rubbish with virtual copy/plagiarism of Mad Max, Zombie Movies, and Apocalypse Now.
Not even a sex scene with Mia Maklova could have saved this movie. If it was not for me ""meeting"" Mia personally before she got in to porn, I would not have watched this movie.",negative

Also the end will shock you!,negative
Nympho: The Lust Story,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6232422/,"I saw this film lying in the HDD. With no idea how it got there, I decided to watch it. After 20 excruciating minutes, I hit the scroll bar and finished the film in another 20 mins. Thats total of 40 mins of my life wasted.

Angrezi Medium,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5547953/,"In one line,Angrezi Medium is a nice,cute,decent movie which had the potential to be so much more !
It's able to portray the message it wants but somewhere it lacks depth & effectiveness in the way it tries to achieve this goal.Homi Adajania has a history of giving some drab scenes in the movie he directs, where you,as an audience,lose connection with the film as a whole.He did this in Cocktail and a lot more in Finding Fanny.
And he repeats the same here, specially during the first 30-45 mins or so where certain unnecessary humour is somehow forcefully thrown at you which ends up being sort of lame.The entire first half is just about average with only 20-25 mins of genuine emotional screenplay time where you actually get the feels of the father-daughter relationshipship.
The second half is still well-directed,the comedy on point and makes you feel for the characters & their lives and certainly brings out the correct tone of the whole thought-process of the movie, enlightening the purity of the special bond that we,as children,share with our parents.The final few minutes are simply gold & will leave you a bit teary-eyed.But overall, the direction should have been much better.This is where the film fails to soar to new heights,it's not tightly knit-up and does end up being a bit here & there,although the story-writer is also to be blamed here to some extent.But what really stands out here are the performances !
The terrific trio of Irrfan Khan,Radhika Madan and Deepak Dobriyal are beyond exceptional !Irrfan returns with a bang, he is just too good in almost every frame,such fantastic dialogue delivery, just Wow ! You really don't get such talented actors too often ! My heart goes out to him !And he is complimented in the best way possible by Radhika.She has definetly proven a point here with her acting skills,the way she expressed,her accent,her crying,her subtle change in voice tone, she really has stood up to the occasion and given a wonderful performance ! Way to go girl !And Deepak is hilarious as usual.He is doing what he does best and there is simply no one in the business like him.Such ease in everything he does,super smooth yet worthy of your laughter, he is supremely gifted. Keep it up man !All these 3 supported by a small yet good cast are the main reasons for watching this movie.Kareena Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia are really good in their respective small roles.Solid performances that really uplift a movie !
And would like to mention the extremely small yet super funny cameo of Pankaj Tripathi.Another great actor !All in all,the movie is really sweet,enjoyable and does succeed in it's message deliverance but it beats around the bush too much and keeps on losing it's track pretty often.It is definetly packed by outstanding performances by the whole cast and some pretty good comedy but all that definetly isn't enough to hold on to a somewhat meandering script,with a plot which seems too contrived and out of place at times,that too, held together by just above average direction.It ultimately ends up being just a feel-good,heart-warming, sweet movie with a nice message, along with some genuine laughter moments.Rating - 3.5/5 (watch it for the brilliant performances)",negative

Guilty,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5532163/,"This is the worst produced movie from Johar's. This is worse than the Student of the year 2 which has 2.5 rating.
After watching this movie you will feel like DU is a red light district of Amsterdam as students gets involved in either smoking joints or girls all girls are crazy for one single guy and keep on seducing him.
A guy carries a girl on his shoulders inside a classroom (I don't think we may find any such college in entire world) and do you know who that girl was? She was the ward of the professor who was lecturing in that class. Is that some kind of spoof or a real movie on MeToo movement? Worst ever representation of a small town girl from Jharkhand.
Totally incoherent story telling.
Now a days it has become a trend of liking any web series with expletives as dialogues and thus so many reviews with good ratings. You will never feel empathetic with the victim. We have seen so many good movies on such topics like Pink, Mardani 2 and extremely wonderful web series Delhi Crime.

But despite all of this, the movie is flawed by its pace where the first half is at times painful to watch with the characters just having random interactions which don't seem to move the plot forward in any way.Overall, I would still recommend this movie if you are ready to reflect upon the society, the people around you and yourself..",positive

The Disciple,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6100908/,"TIFF 2020 10The DiscipleNever in my life I thought watching a film about Indian classical music would be remotely interesting. However The disciple, a film directed by Chaitanya Tamhane, has proved my wrong. It's about a student and performer of the classical music in India which is also called Raag, who is desperate to become one of the greats.The film is a multi-layered, beautifully textured character study of a man's journey and devotion to a goal he might or might not reach. It thoroughly captures one's doubts, fears and uncertainties about if one is good enough for the task ahead. It has somewhat a slow start and things get more and more relatable and resonating as we go through the sitting. At the end, the whole experience feels complete and satisfactory.",negative
The Disciple,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6218820/,"'The Disciple' is a movie about a journey of an artist and how it pans out over the years. This movie is beautifully directed with on the spot set pieces and full of Indian classical music. The music is so tastefully presented that, even if you are not familiar with it, it sucks you in with its atmosphere and carries over the whole movie.I speak Marathi, so it was even better experience for me, as the dialogs feels very natural along with all the production. The movie moves slowly, showing us daily struggles of an artist who wants to make it big in field with rapidly declining scope. This along with an amazing lead performance and atmospheric music and brilliant production design makes it worth a watch.Its a very solid character study, I can easily see this getting such a wide applause.",positive

The film stabs to touch major life milestones of her life from her genius mathematics career to conflict with her own daughter and to her dilemma in life to her flawed rapport with her husband.But the film fails to bring out her psyche, mental vows and keeps spinning around her analogous achievements throughout.

The set-up is hardly new - bereaved father teaming up with law enforcement's last honest representative. Yet, writer Ghibran Noorani and director Randeep Jha bring energy and freshness to familiar material.

He would have earned more respect from us audience,if a good 10 minutes were devoted on his skit in the beginning of the movie.2) Charlie's accent is that of a middle class well earning Indian in a city. It would have been better if he did an accent or dialect of a villager. In one scene , he reasons with his circus employer, and both of them looks and talks like they are from the same social class.3) I felt that a movie like this could have wringed out so much emotions but it doesnt(Anurag Basu's Barfi could wring out emotion).

The film deserves some credit the way it unfolds itself and despite being loud it keeps you guessing. The frequent dutch angels reminds you of the old hindi thriller films .The film lacks good or even decent editing but maybe the budget is the reason behind that .The film although revolves around a family but it completely deviates from the exploring the main characters and also several key aspects of the film is ignored. The film invests all it's attention to bring in the twist in the end in the most bizarre way. At first the twist may shock you or even to some extent impress you but when they try to match the dots to justify the twist you will remain unsatisfied .The twist may confuse you in two ways either it's completely lame or shockingly well made.

Vilom,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6268034/,"Before I start to talk about the film, I'm going to mention the storyline provided here on IMDB. The person who wrote that farrago of tosh clearly hasn't seen the film at all. No woman called Nivi ""moves in"" with Vilom and Amay. She is simply an actress who is working on a project with Vilom and who makes a rejected pass at him. There are no ""gender-blending gay/straight relationships"" to speak of, just a relationship between the two male leads. EDIT: I see that whoever wrote the storyline has changed it in light of my review. It's still nonsense, I'm afraid. There is no reassessment or examination of motive or sexuality. He has no idea that Nivi wanted to have sex with him - and that's all it is, she is not in love with him. He refuses, she leaves disgustedly when he says he's gay. There is no ""sudden love triangle"". I don't know where this fantasy is coming from.The film is about the two nice looking lads Vilom and Amay and how they meet and gradually fall in love. The story is set 10 years in the past and is framed by the decriminalisation and subsequent recriminalisation of homosexuality in India, a theme that has repercussions on the lives of our heroes.During those few years, we see their ups and downs as well as the reactions of society to their relationship as well as the social imperatives that can drive even gay guys to marry to please their families. A shocking act of violence against the two lovers leads them to a reassessment of and realignment in their lives.I'm always dubious when people play parts in a language that isn't theirs. However, both male actors had fluent, albeit accented English and broke into the language much of the time as educated, middle class Indians do. Nivi was less fluent, but had a far smaller role so her language skills were less important. I watched with subtitles and needed them even for the English dialogue as I'm going slightly deaf, however someone with normal hearing would not need them at all if they speak both Hindi and English. Someone with no Hindi would need the subs, of course. At 82 minutes, this film was just about right in its length. Any longer and it would have lost its focus.I enjoyed it and was rooting for the guys despite the sense of impending doom engendered by the very first scene. I can't give it more than a six, but having said that, it was a good film that held this viewer's attention as a glimpse into a faraway world where love dares not speak its name .",negative
Vilom,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6118994/,I was so unexpectedly moved by this sensitive and beautifully directed drama about the realities of gay love in small town India. I strongly urge everyone to check this out. The film is one of the most achingly accurate portraits of the lives of these individuals. It truly deserves to be seen by a wider audience and released on streaming platforms. Right now it is available as a DVD from TLA releasing in the United States. Please seek it and check it out if you can.,positive

Mee Raqsam,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6017058/,"Giving it 2 stars - 1 for the story & emotion behind it and 2nd for the music/lyrics.Yes the daughter & father bonding was absolutely beautiful to watch and the fact that art has no religion or boundaries and one has to pursue one's dreams which means there will be a lot of sacrifices and a heavy price to pay.But there is a way of telling any story - creating a feature film demands a lot more. It could have been due to the fact that this film did not get enough finance to hire the right people in the production team.The lead character Maryam did not seem to have to learn a single step, it was just as if she was born with it - which doesn't happen, I cringed at the lack of struggle shown.
In the opening scene Maryam's mother performs in front of her for a minute and dies suddenly for absolutely no reason - weakness of the screenplay. An intelligent viewer would demand a better explanation no matter how short.
Saleem, the tailor and Maryam's father cannot even afford to buy 2 kilograms of sugar although he manages to afford paying for her dance school fees, the struggle & effort to earn that money or the source where he arranged it from would have connected the dots.
The girl who played Maryam might be a talented young dancer herself and hence selected to play this character but the accent coach should have worked a little harder to make her pronounce the word ""Khaala"" correctly - it was quite irritating to hear incorrect throughout the movie. I expected something better from people like Baba and Shabana Azmi being behind this project.
And what about her being the only girl wearing a head scarf, it would have made more sense if other Muslim females including her aunt and cousins and those Muslim girls who featured in the sewing class scene were made to wear some ""burqa"" or ""hijaab"" or a head scarf.
Editing, Cinematography & Dialogues were decent enough.
In the acting department of course Danish Hussain playing Salim and Shraddha Kaul playing the aunt own this movie - they were both absolutely brilliant.
And the great Naseeruddin Shah - well - they needed somebody to market and sell the film with.",negative

The uniform was completely wrong. Ranks were wrong.
No proper planning before mission? Our Army is not so stupid to start a mission without planning it out properly.
Please don't take such movies without proper reserch being done at least basic research is to be done regarding ranks and uniforms.
And never will an officer leave a man behind to die.Above are just a few out of all the stupid things in the movie.Please don't take such movies.Rated 1 as I couldn't rate less than that but I really will rate it minus 10 (-10) .",negative
